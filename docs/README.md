## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. **Identify the user intent**: Is this teaching, guiding, referencing, or explaining?
2. **Choose the appropriate category** based on Diátaxis principles
3. **Follow naming conventions**: Use kebab-case, descriptive names
4. **Update index files**: Add entries to the appropriate README.md
5. **Cross-reference**: Link related documents across categories

## Project Status

- **Current Phase**: Implementation Complete
- **Last Updated**: November 2025
- **Documentation Structure**: Diátaxis-organized
